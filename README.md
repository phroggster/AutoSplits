# phroggster's AutoSplitters for LiveSplit

This is a collection of ASL scripts for use with LiveSplit that I have written and attempt to maintain.

- [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) - Here you can find out more about and download LiveSplit. It is a popular timer program typically used for speedruns.
- [ASL](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters/blob/master/README.md) - Here you can find more information about the Auto Splitting Language (ASL) (basically C#) and autosplitters in general.
- [Spiraster's ASLScripts](https://github.com/Spiraster/ASLScripts) - A good source of real-world examples for how to implement these things.
